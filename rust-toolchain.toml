[toolchain]
# Keep the workspace-root toolchain aligned with `src-tauri/rust-toolchain.toml`.
# This prevents rust-analyzer (often rooted at the repo) from using a different
# rustc than Cargo when compiling proc-macros (e.g. `serde_derive`), which can
# cause "proc macro server error: ... mismatched ABI expected ... got ..." on Windows.
