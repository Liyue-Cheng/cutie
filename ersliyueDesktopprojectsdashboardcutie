    feat: implement original notebook-inspired UI with task strips
    
    ORIGINAL DESIGN FEATURES:
    - Notebook metaphor: completely new UI paradigm inspired by paper journals
    - Task Strip component: tasks displayed as journal entries with dashed separators
    - No rounded corners, no side borders - authentic notebook aesthetic
    - Left panel: stacked task strips with clean dashed dividers (like ruled paper)
    - Right panel: 7-day week calendar view
    
    COMPLETE DATA INTEGRATION:
    - TaskBar: uses viewKey system (VIEW_CONTEXT_KEY_SPEC compliant)
    - Full pipeline integration: task creation, completion toggle, subtask management
    - Automatic data sync via useViewTasks composable
    - Support for all view contexts: daily::*, misc::staging, misc::completed
    
    STYLING INNOVATIONS:
    - Remove all list padding for edge-to-edge task strips
    - 2px dashed borders (bottom only) for clear visual separation
    - Darker border color for enhanced visibility
    - Hover effects maintain notebook aesthetic
    
    This is a completely original design approach, distinct from traditional kanban layouts.
